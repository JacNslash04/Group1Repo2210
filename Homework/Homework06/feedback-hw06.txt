SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm: perfect, works as advertised.  Good for you, finding
   out how to call "C" functions and using ARM code!  Very nice.

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c: perfect again.  Nice.

problem 3 partiygen.nasm: made a couple of changes to this one to get it to
   work for windows, then it compiles, links, and runs fine.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c: perfect

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c: this one is not what the specification
   asked for.  It should be a single function to swap the byte order if it's
   needed, then another program file to call that function to test it out.
   Your testMakeNBO.c program just tries to 'make' the program which is not
   what's required.  when I run the program, I get no output, and it appears
   to be in an endless loop.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm: on this one, I think there is something
   wrong with this code.  There are several 'calSwapBytOrder' function calls
   in the nasm code, but no such function.  Not sure what's that about...
   It is supposed to be a nasm main program that calls your "C" function to
   make network byte order...

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  88.89% of  5 points =  4.45 points
   homework04 ~  87.78% of  5 points =  4.39 points
   homework05 ~ 100.00% of 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework06 ~  81.00% of 15 points = 12.15 points
                       semester total: 40.99 out of 45.00 = 91.09%
                             which is an A-minus

Very nice work on all these assignments!  It's been great being in class with
you all and I look forward to seeing you next semester!  I hope you all have
a wonderful holiday.
