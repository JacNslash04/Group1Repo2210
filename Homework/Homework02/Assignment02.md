#### Due: Sep 13, 2023 

1.) What is a "computer system"?  
> A computer system is the amalgamation of each part of the computer. Starting with the digital logic and hardware of the computer, the computer system builds upon itself to create a sophisticated set of layers that enables the user (us!) to perform our day to day tasks.    
      
2.) What are some of the parts of a computer system?   
>  The lowest level of the computer system is the digital logic/hardware, then firmware was created using digital logic. Next is the instruction set architecture which uses firmware to determine how software interacts with parts of the computer, such as the CPU. Using the instruction set architecture, system software is created, which is what forms our operating systems. Next is the assembly code, which are instructions that talks with the computer’s hardware. Using assembly, higher level languages (such as C, Java, etc.) can make programming easier. Lastly, the user of a computer can use programs that were built with high level languages.  
     
3.) What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?  
> Compiled languages are those that are translated by a compiler before being ran by the machine. They are usually faster and will be executed directly from the machine. Interpreted languages are executed via a different program, also known as the interpreter. These languages are slower and bugs will only be caught during runtime (rather than during compilation). (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/)   
     
4.) Is "C" a compiled language?  
> Yes, but it is not compiled like Java. Since there is no virtual machine, you must access the functions provided by the operating system yourself. This code is first compiled directly to binary and then read by the computer. This makes the language very fast.   
     
5.) Who invented the "C" language?  
>Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in ‘72. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)    
     
6.) How long has "C" been in use?  
> 51 years, since 1972. C was originally developed to construct utilities for the operating systems Unix. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)    
    
7.) Is a compiler a translator?  
> Yes, Similar to an assembler, the compiler works as a translator in the process of converting source code to machine code that our processor can read. The compiler translates high level languages into assembly code, then an assembler is used to convert that to machine code. 
      
8.) Is an assembler a translator?  
> Yes, the assembler acts as a translator in order for our processor to read what we have written in complex languages. In this process high level languages such as C are compiled into assembly code, then our assembler is able to translate the assembly code into machine code that our processor can read to perform the intended actions.   
      
9.) What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?  
> The command to list the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window is “ls” or “ls <directory>” (Command Line Page)
     
10.) What does the "C" function ***atof()*** do?  
> The atof() function in C converts a string to a float number as the function name stands for “ASCII to Float”.   
      
11.) What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief description of each.  
> The bottom two layers of a computer system are the Digital Logic Layer and the Control Layer. The Digital Logic Layer consists of the hardware that all of the computer’s operations run on. Examples of this layer can be found in gates, circuitry, motherboards, chips, etc. The Control Layer contains the microcode that utilizes the hardware of the Digital Logic layer for its execution.  
      
12.) What are the three "steps" of the Von Neumann Architecture?  
> The 3 steps of Von Neumann Architecture are as follows: 1) Fetch, 2) Decode, and 3) Execute.   
     
13.) What is the purpose of an ALU?  
> An ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a part of the CPU and serves the purpose of performing operations that are done on integers (mathematical and bit-wise operations).   
      
14.) What is a "register"?   
> A register is the part of a CPU that serves the purpose of storing the addresses of instructions that the CPU must execute. One example of a register is the Program Counter.  
       
15.) What is one difference between "Application software" and "System software"?  
> A difference between Application Software and System Software is that Application Software deals with human-oriented abstractions (customers, products, users, etc.) while Systems Software deals with computer-based concepts (registers and memory locations).   
     
16.) Is the phrase ***cmp rdi, rsi*** machine language?  
>  No, machine language is pure binary. The phrase ***cmp rdi, rsi*** is an example of assembly language.   
     
17.) How many buses are included in the system bus?  
>.  There are a total of 3 buses included in the system bus: The Data Bus, The Address Bus, and The Control Bus.   
     
18.) What is the decimal value of $10010111_2$?    
>The decimal value of $10010111_2$ is $151_{10}$.   
     
19.) What is the decimal value of $11111111_2$?   
> The decimal value of $11111111_2$ is $255_{10}$.   
     
20.) What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?  
> The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is $65,535_{10}$.
